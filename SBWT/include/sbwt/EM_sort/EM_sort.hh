Design:
  
There are two operating modes: EM_LINES and EM_CONSTANT_BINARY. The mode determines
how records are represented in disk and memory.


EM_BINARY:
  - Records are in binary such that the first 8 bytes are the big-endian representation
    of a 64-bit integer x. Then follows x-8 bytes of data. The comparison function now takes
    as a parameter the pointers to the starts of the x byte block of data of the records.
    When passing around records, the size x is always at the start of the data array.
  - Internal workings: The records are read from disk into an object of class Block, which
    has a char-array which will store the concatenation of all records. A vector<int64_t> 'starts'
    stores the start position of each record. Sorting is done by permuting 'starts' and keeping
    the data in place. The data is written back to disk according to the permutation of starts.

EM_CONSTANT_BINARY is similar, but there is no record size included in the records and they
are assumed to be a given constant size instead.
